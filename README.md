# kmdashboard_V2
The master branch is where I am diverting from single screen dash, query and search results. “version2” is where I will convert the site to three or more pages to fit the needs of the project better.

The master branch has very little added to it but I can find all the work leading up to it D:\OneDrive\Documents\professional\20210430fileShareApp.
