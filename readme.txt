“version2” branch is where I will convert the site to three or more pages to fit the needs of the project better.

The master branch is where I am diverting from single screen dash, query and search results. The master branch has very little added to it but I can find all the work leading up to it D:\OneDrive\Documents\professional\20210430fileShareApp.

main branch doesn't have anything. This was just a result of me creating the repo on github. I made the first readme there, but don't really know what to do with it.
