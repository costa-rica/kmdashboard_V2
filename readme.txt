"version3" is new branch set for production.

Somewhere since setting up logging version2 stopped displaying NameError. NameError helps flag when a module is not imported to the working module but the code uses it. This would just cause the app to go blank except for the background. Version 3 picks up from prior_logging which picked up version2's commit just prior to logging was set up.

“version2” branch is where I will convert the site to three or more pages to fit the needs of the project better.

The master branch is where I am diverting from single screen dash, query and search results. The master branch has very little added to it but I can find all the work leading up to it D:\OneDrive\Documents\professional\20210430fileShareApp.

main branch doesn't have anything. This was just a result of me creating the repo on github. I made the first readme there, but don't really know what to do with it.
